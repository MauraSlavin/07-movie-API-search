Displayed are the movie poster, and these details about the movie to the right of the poster:
    - Year released;
    - Director;
    - MPAA rating;
    - Stars;
    - Rotten Tomatoes rating.

The plot, a link to a NY Times review, and posters of suggested similar movies are displayed next.

The user can search a new movie in two ways:
1.  clicking on a recommended poster
        (which puts the movie name in the search field), then click on the search icon or hit enter; or
2.  entering a new movie name, and clicking the search icon or hitting enter.

The new movie is loaded the same as the first movie, with the first movie existing as collapsed element at the bottom of the page.

This process can be repeated as often as desired, with newly searched movies appending to the top of the page.

It is responsive to different screen sizes.

The following errors are caught and communicated to the user:
- No movie found
- No Rotten Tomatoes rating found (another pulled, or message saying none found if there are none)
- No movie poster found
- No other movie suggestions found


Let us help you find a movie you know you'll enjoy!
